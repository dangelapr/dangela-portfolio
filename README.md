learned about BEM

challenged myself to use mainly html and css

goal was to commit more often and using clear and concise commit messages

following the original tutorial prompted me to look up CSS best practices. I knew to do most of these already, but it was really helpful to be able to hear an explanation why.

margins and padding on text, use ems 

learned how to make nav slide in and out!
    .nav-open .nav {
        transform: translateX(0);
    }


learned about using turn units for transforms

plain CSS smooth scroll behavior without using JS!
